## README

This is a very basic website using fundamental html and css practices. 
In this repository, you will find several folders

1. The **layout** folder which contains the main layout for the pages as well as the post.html for the posts
2. The *post* folder which has all the blog posts 
    3.  The *blog* folder which holds the html information for how to format the post list
4. The main CSS folder which formats how the simple website looks 
5. The config.yml folder, this website uses jekyll so this folder tells jekyll basic information about the website (what Jekyll isnt telling us though, is why he's call that?) 

So that's it really, for more information or any questions, please do not contact me, I probably dont know any more than this.
